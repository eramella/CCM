# Code Camp Management

## A web application to manage code camps or other small events

This is my personal project started as volunteer work for the local Code Camp and then becoming my little side project.
If you find this work interesting please give it a star and feel free to download it and use it as you please. We still are in the early stages and many features are missing. I will try to document my intent with this project through the Issues and I am accepting suggestions and PR.

The project is built with [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/) for the back-end and a mix of spa and MVC for the front-end. [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/) is my client framework of choice. MS-SQL is the data store.

If you fork or clone or download this project you will be better off using [VS 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/) or above. By way of VS you don't need to restore any package (Nuget or NPM) as VS will do it for you.

Again any comment or suggestions are very  much appreciate it.
